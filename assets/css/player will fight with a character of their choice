player will fight with a character of their choice
$(document).ready(function(){
	
		// at start choose a character picture need function
			//need functionality to creat characters,
			how to store characters 
			Possible solutions:objects/arrays?
			output those characters to the screen as html
			doc getelementbyID
		// need way of tracking main character 

		// Every character that was not picked is now an enemy that the player must defeat. Enemies shoule be moved to a different area of the screen. 
			//need functionality that tracking enemies and outputs them to other part of screen.
		// possibly neet to use existing div.
		// 

		The player chooses which enemy they will attack by clicking on the enemy's picture
			// using jquery use some kind of event handling for clicks -- 
			// once event is fired ther should be functionality to move that enemy to a defender area -- Will likely need another area for this. 


});

//  want to fade out and then fade in with new image - 
To fade one image out and fade another one in, you can pass a callback function to fadeOut. Inside the callback (which will be called as soon as the fadeout animation completes), swap out the img src and fade it back in:
$("#showImage").fadeOut(
  function(){
    $(this).attr('src', drawCard[drawNum])
    .fadeIn();
  }
); // end fadeOut
